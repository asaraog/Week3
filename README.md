## Setting up a Website

### Project Summary

Our company 'AutoNotes' aims to build an personal knowledge base product that rivals Obsidian without the need to know Markdown syntax. Go will be help power our backend web and database servers and distributed service offerings on the cloud. However, additional investors will be needed for this year-long project. To promote our product, we have created a basic website using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io). The theme for this website is the [Hugo Winston theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-winston-theme/). This theme does have a [Live Demo](https://hugo-winston.netlify.app/) which made it simple to deploy onto [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). All descriptions are fictional and generated using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).

## Installation

To use this theme you will first need to have Hugo installed. Please follow the official [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

> ⚠️ **Note:** Check your Hugo version - **Hugo Extended** is required!

**2. Import Hugo site locally**

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser. Files can then be changed and then committed/pushed when complete to git. Once pushed to git, the website will be updated on the deployed Netlify website [autonotes.netlify.app](https://autonotes.netlify.app/).
