Personal knowledge base products tap into a need we all have: to organize our ideas over time. We read something and make a note of it. We read something else and make another note. We see that things are related and make a note of that as well. At one time or another, everyone has used a Google KeepLinks to an external site. or Microsoft OneNoteLinks to an external site.. Memo-makers and note-keepers opened the door to personal knowledge bases. ObsidianLinks to an external site. walked through that door, moving further along. They see that the power isn't in the individual notes, but in the links between the notes. To foster creativity and productivity, we need a kind of mind-map or graph database of ideas. But Obsidian, as currently defined, has limited potential. What user in the general public knows Markdown, which is needed for formatting the Obsidian notes? And why ask the user to manually enter links between ideas when AI can do it automatically? We can do better than Obsidian, and we have the technical savvy to pull it off.
